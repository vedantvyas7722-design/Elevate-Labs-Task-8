# **Task 8: VPN Setup and Analysis (Summary)**

### **Objective**

The goal was to gain hands-on experience with VPN technology by installing a VPN client, verifying its ability to mask a public IP address, and understanding its role in online privacy.

### **Process Overview**

1. **Baseline Check:** Documented the original, real public IP address using an online tool.  
2. **Setup:** Installed and configured the ProtonVPN client on a Windows 11 machine.  
3. **Connection:** Established a secure, encrypted connection to a remote VPN server using the "Quick Connect" feature.  
4. **Verification:** Confirmed that the public IP address had successfully changed to that of the VPN server, proving the VPN was routing traffic and masking the original IP.

### **Key Findings**

The experiment was a success. The VPN client was easy to set up and effectively masked the original IP address, replacing it with one from a different geographic location. This practical test demonstrated the core privacy benefit of a VPN: its ability to hide a user's true location and encrypt their internet traffic from local network snooping.
